NBARandomTeam
=============

NBA2k14 for  the Next Gen consoles (PS4 and XboxOne) do not allow for the user to select a random team to play 
with in an offline quick match. This functionality, of having a 1 vs 1 match up with someone, 
each getting 3 random teams and selecting 1 of the 3 to play with, is a common standard in sports games. 
Because the game lacked this functionality, I made a simply iOS application that would allow you to select 
3 random teams and if you did not like any of the three you could click the "Random" button a second time and 
it would give you your 4th and final choice.

Simply press the "Random" button in the bottom corner. It will display 3 teams randomly. Typically it is common for 
you to either choose one of those 3 random teams to play with, or you can select a fourth random tema that you MUST
play with regardless of who they are. Selecting the "Random" button a second time will display that 4th team for you. 
The user can then clear the selection by tapping the button on the bottom right, or by pressing "Random" again they will
be given a new batch of 3 random teams.
